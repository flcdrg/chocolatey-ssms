    <summary>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server</summary>
    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

- This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server (SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle?C2=1044), and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
- There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
- Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side-by-side with SSMS 16.X or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 (SP1), Windows Server 2012 (64-bit), Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit), Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

SSMS 17.0 is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility very seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. Because of this, we do not anticipate that SSMS with all latest updates applied) will encounter issues when running on Windows Server 2016. Customers are advised to contact support, should they encounter any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016. Support will then work with customers to determine if the issue is with SSMS or Visual Studio or with Windows compatibility, and route the issue appropriately.
